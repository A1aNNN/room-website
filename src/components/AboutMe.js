          Iâ€™m currently in my last year at the University of British
          Columbia studying computer science and biochemistry.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite being a retired swimmer (or should I say "swammer"), I'm still always on the move.
          Volleyball, ping pong, or even gearing up for a 10k race, I'm there if it means staying active!
          <br />
          <br />
          Otherwise, you might catch me sipping my 10th coffee for the day, heading to a Mario Kart tournament,
          or chilling at home trying to make a scuffed 3D donut on Blender.
