            Iâ€™m currently a 5th year undergraduate student at the University of British 
            Columbia studying computer science and biochemistry.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Despite being a retired swimmer (or should I say "swammer"), I'm still always on the move. 
            Bowling, ping pong, or even gearing up for a 10k race, I'm there if it means staying active!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Otherwise, you might catch me sipping my 10th coffee for the day, 
            or chilling at home giving it my all (and sometimes failing) to craft the perfect 3D donut on Blender. 
            <br/>
